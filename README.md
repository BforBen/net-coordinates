net-coordinates
===============

Source originally from http://www.doogal.co.uk/dotnetcoords.php - This C# library can be used to convert from one mapping coordinate system to another, for instance converting latitude/longitude to UK OS coordinates. It is based on the JCoord class library and is therefore licensed under the GPL. It also should have all the features available in that library.
